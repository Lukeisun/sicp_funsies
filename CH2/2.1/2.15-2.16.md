While both forms are algebraically equivalent, Eva Lu Ator is right in the world of computing.
Representing floating points is a well known difficult problem in Computer Science, that I 
have personally never ventured far into. As to why logically Eva is right I do not have a concrete answer.

My answer is similar to above. However I will add that I think about it in this way;
think back to your physics classes. Numerical answers were accepted if they were in a certain range of each other. 
Why? Because depending on if you rounded up/down even a little in your calculations your answer would be slightly off. 
I would bet that even depending on calculator you would get different results as well a calculator is a computer.
