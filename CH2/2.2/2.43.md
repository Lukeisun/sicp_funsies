Louis is calling (queen-cols (- k 1)) for each interval, so in just ont iteration
we call this procedure board-size times. And it's doing *a lot* of extra work
since we are now doing Tree recursion instead of iterative recursion. So for each
number in the enumeration (board-size) we are calling queen-cols board-size times.
With board-size = n, we are calling (queen-cols) n^n times. In our regular
procedure we only ever call (queen-cols) n times. 

Drawing out the tree, I believe we get the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n-1)*(n-1)
Solving this we get something like (1 * (n-n+1))*(n-n+2)*...*(n-2)*(n-1), which would be O(n^n)

My algo-analysis definitely isn't the strongest, especially here :(. Pretty unsatisfied with
my answer but don't want to spend more time on it.
